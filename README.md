Assignment 8


1.Extract the ResNet18 model from this repository and add it to your API/repo.

2.Use data loader, model loading, train, and test code to train ResNet18 on Cifar10.


3.Achieve Target is 85% accuracy. No limit on the number of epochs. Use default ResNet18 code (so params are fixed).


4.One of the layers must use Dilated Convolution
