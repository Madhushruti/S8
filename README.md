Assignment 8


Extract the ResNet18 model from this repository and add it to your API/repo.
Use data loader, model loading, train, and test code to train ResNet18 on Cifar10
Achieve Target is 85% accuracy. No limit on the number of epochs. Use default ResNet18 code (so params are fixed).
one of the layers must use Dilated Convolution
